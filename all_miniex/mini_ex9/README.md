# Working with APIs

1) First, take a deep breath. This mini exercise may requires time. You have 2 weeks to work on it.

2) Design a program that utilizes a web API (below is just a suggestion, and you can search for others). You need to pay attention to your process of acquiring, processing, using and representing data.

  - [Open Weather with code example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI)
  - [Other weather API by apix with code example](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-weather.html)
  - [New York times with code example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMne3LY4bks&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r&index=9)
  - [Giphy images with code example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8_w11MvH8&index=10&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r)
  - [Twitter API and Twitter Bot with code example](http://shiffman.net/a2z/twitter-bots/)
  - [Movie API with code example](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/movie-api-data/)
  - [Global statistic API with code example](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/inqubu-global-statistics-api/)
  - [Google map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
  - [Search many other kinds of API](https://www.programmableweb.com/)
  
>> for those APIs require OAuth, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). See what is Node [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV) for 15.1 and 15.2

3) Upload your sketch to your blog and include: 
- Which API have you chosen? and Why? 
- Please indicate if your work requires to download and run on our own computer. 
- Can you describe your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?
- What is your reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data?
